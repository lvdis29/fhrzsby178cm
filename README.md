🎀 fahreza.os  
A tiny little web project I made as a birthday surprise for Fahreza.  
Not a real operating system of course, just a playful website pretending to be one.  
The idea was simple:  
instead of sending a normal birthday message, I wanted to build something interactive, weird, and a little bit funny.  
So yeah… welcome to fahreza.os.  

📱What This Is  
This is basically a fake operating system styled birthday page.  
Inside it you’ll find:  
a locked system boot screen  
some messages written like terminal commands  
a small memory vault  
two ridiculous mini games  
and a couple of chaotic notes  
It’s half birthday card, half inside joke.  

💻 Why I Made This  
Because sending “happy birthday” in a normal chat felt boring.  
So instead, this became:  
birthday message  
dumb jokes  
coding aesthetic  
random mini games    
which somehow turned into a whole fake system interface.  

🛠️ Technologies Used  
HTML5: Semantic structure.  
CSS3: Custom animations, Flexbox, Glassmorphism, and responsive design.  
JavaScript (Vanilla): Game logic, DOM manipulation, and system events.  
Fonts: Dancing Script (Headings) & Fira Code (Terminal).  

🖥️ Fake OS Interface  
root_access.sh	= Halaman utama berisi pesan ulang tahun  
meeting_req.cfg	= Pesan ajakan untuk bertemu  
memory_leak.vault	= Gallery foto dan video kenangan  
system_patch.fix	= Halaman apology / patch message  
mini_game.exe =	Game klik cepat  
aero_fahreza.sys	= Game flappy  
bug_report.log	= Halaman untuk curhat / talk  
system_prefs.json	= Informasi sistem  

🎨 Aesthetic  
The system theme mixes:  
terminal style UI  
soft coquette colors  
falling cute emojis  
animated background text  
code-style messages  
Basically developer energy but pink.  

🧠 Final Note  
this project isn’t meant to be perfect.  
it’s just a small, chaotic thing I made  
because I thought it would be more fun than a normal birthday text.  
so yeah.  
happy birthday, Fahreza.  
enjoy the fake operating system.  
and please…  
don’t lose the memories again.
