🎀 fahreza.os  
a tiny little web project I made as a birthday surprise for Fahreza  
not a real operating system of course, just a playful website pretending to be one  
the idea was simple:  
instead of sending a normal birthday message, I wanted to build something interactive, weird, and a little bit funny  
so yeah… welcome to fahreza.os  

📱What This Is  
this is basically a fake operating system styled birthday page  
inside it you’ll find:  
a locked system boot screen  
some messages written like terminal commands  
a small memory vault  
two ridiculous mini games  
and a couple of chaotic notes  
it’s half birthday card, half inside joke.  

💻 Why I Made This  
because sending “happy birthday” in a normal chat felt boring  
so instead, this became:  
birthday message  
dumb jokes  
coding aesthetic  
random mini games    
which somehow turned into a whole fake system interface  

🛠️ Technologies Used  
HTML5: Semantic structure  
CSS3: Custom animations, Flexbox, Glassmorphism, and responsive design  
JavaScript (Vanilla): Game logic, DOM manipulation, and system events  
Fonts: Dancing Script (Headings) & Fira Code (Terminal)  

🖥️ Fake OS Interface  
root_access.sh	= Halaman utama berisi pesan ulang tahun  
meeting_req.cfg	= Pesan ajakan untuk bertemu  
memory_leak.vault	= Gallery foto dan video kenangan  
system_patch.fix	= Halaman apology / patch message  
mini_game.exe =	Game klik cepat  
aero_fahreza.sys	= Game flappy  
bug_report.log	= Halaman untuk curhat / talk  
system_prefs.json	= Informasi sistem  

🎨 Aesthetic  
the system theme mixes:  
terminal style UI  
soft coquette colors  
falling cute emojis  
animated background text  
code-style messages  
Basically developer energy but pink.  

🧠 Final Note  
this project isn’t meant to be perfect  
it’s just a small, chaotic thing I made  
because I thought it would be more fun than a normal birthday text  
so yeah  
happy birthday, Fahreza  
enjoy the fake operating system  
and please…  
don’t lose the memories again
